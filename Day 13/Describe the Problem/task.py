# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
    #"""The for loop loops through 1 to 20 and when the value of i matches 20, it prints "You got it""""
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
    # when the iterator values matches 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
    # every time the loop runs, the value of i is incremented until it reaches values 20
    # or the id condition is matched
